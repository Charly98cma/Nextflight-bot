# Nextflight_bot

## Basic info

## Dependencies
This bots uses mainly 2 packages, **python-telegram-bot** and **launch-library**, the first is available on *pip*, but the second is only on Git (but this ain't a problem :D).

Both packages can be installed by executing the next command, which gives the `requirements.txt` to *pip* and does his installation process:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And... you're almost ready to take off :P
